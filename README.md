**Project Name: OLX Clone**
_Overview_
Welcome to the OLX Clone project! üåê This exciting venture replicates the functionality of the popular online marketplace OLX, enabling users to engage in buying and selling across a variety of categories. Our tech stack is top-notch, featuring Django for the backend, PostgreSQL as the database powerhouse, and Flutter for the sleek mobile app development.

**Tech Stack**
_Django_: The backend magic is orchestrated by Django, a high-level Python web framework. Django seamlessly handles user authentication, database models, and the core logic of the OLX Clone.

_PostgreSQL_: Powering our data kingdom is PostgreSQL, the reliable and robust database management system. PostgreSQL ensures seamless data storage and retrieval for the OLX Clone.

_Flutter_: For the frontend and mobile app dazzle, we've chosen Flutter. üöÄ Flutter, Google's UI toolkit, crafts natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase, promising a consistent and responsive user experience across platforms.

**Project Structure**
_Backend (Django):_ The backend is the brain of the operation, managing user authentication, product listings, transactions, and more. Django's REST framework creates APIs that the Flutter frontend dances with.

_Database (PostgreSQL):_ Our data kingdom is ruled by PostgreSQL, storing and managing user profiles, product listings, and transactions efficiently. The database schema is designed to meet the demands of a bustling online marketplace.

_Frontend (Flutter):_ The Flutter app paints a vibrant canvas for both buyers and sellers. Users can effortlessly browse products, create listings, and engage in transactions. The app's design is responsive and adaptable, ensuring a delightful experience on various screen sizes.
